    <section class="mt-5">
      <h2 class="h4">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        CardCrafter (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information
        when you use our flashcard creation and sharing app. No information is collected unless
        you decide to create an account for accessing public decks or saving your decks online.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2 class="h4">2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item">
          <strong>Email address:</strong> Used for account creation, login,
          password recovery, and occasional service announcements.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
          <strong>Owner profile:</strong> If you choose to upload public decks,
          we ask for a username and display name so other users know who created them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2">
        <em>No other personal data</em> (location, contacts, device identifiers,
        or usage metrics) is collected or stored by CardCrafter.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2 class="h4">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Authentication:</strong> Secure sign-in and password recovery.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Deck ownership:</strong> Associate uploads with the correct user.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Service updates:</strong> Critical bug fixes and announcements.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2 class="h4">4. Password Security</h2>
      <p>
        We never store or transmit your password in plain text. Industry-standard
        encryption and hashing keep your credentials safe. Passwords are never shared.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2 class="h4">5. Cloud-Stored Deck Data</h2>
      <p>
        Decks you synchronize remain private, but you can upload decks of your choosing to the public
        if and only if you become a owner. Public decks display only the Owner's username/display name—not your email or password.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2 class="h4">6. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with advertisers
        or unaffiliated third parties. Public deck metadata is visible only to
        other CardCrafter users.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mt-4">
      <h2 class="h4">7. Children Under 13</h2>
      <p>
        As of now, CardCrafter is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly
        collect personal data from anyone under 13. If you believe we have, please
