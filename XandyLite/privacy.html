            <h2 class="h4">1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Xandy Lite (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a lightweight music player that lets users play audio files and
                edit music metadata (tags) locally on their device.
                <strong>Xandy Lite does not collect, transmit, or store personal user information.</strong> Any edits
                you make to metadata are applied to files stored on your device only.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0"><strong>Intended users:</strong> people who can navigate a phone and love music.</p>

                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Playback:</strong> Read-only access to local media files to play
                    audio.</li>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2 class="h4">4. File Access & Permissions</h2>
            <p>
                To function, Xandy Lite requests the minimum device permissions required to access your local audio
                files (for example, media storage permissions). Permissions are requested by the operating system and
                only used locally to read or modify the files you choose to edit. The app does not retain extra copies
                or send file contents anywhere.
            </p>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2 class="h4">5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
            <p>
                Xandy Lite <strong>does not</strong> sell, share, or disclose personal information or usage data to
                advertisers, analytics providers, or any unaffiliated third parties. There are no built-in cloud sync,
                analytics, or ad SDKs.

            <p>
                Xandy Lite is not intended for children under 13. Because the app does not collect personal information,
                we do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe personal data has been provided by a
                child, please address the issue through the app store listing or parental controls on your device.
